                Welcome To My Grateful Dead HTML Generating TwitterBot!
            </h1>
            <p>
                This bot was made both as a personal project to familiarize myself with the Twitter api
                and out of a deep irrational love for Grateful Dead. I'm a cat mom, deadhead, Taco Bell enthusiast, and a computer engineer.
                This project was developed using python with the tweepy library  and using tools such as Git and Visual Studio.
                The intended purpose of this bot was host a monthly CSS competition through twitter by providing pseudorandom
                generated HTML files. The HTML file is not to be edited and only the CSS file (style.css) is to be submitted.
            </p>

                Hell in a Bucket  Well I was drinkin' last night with a biker And I showed him a picture of you I said, "Pal get to know her, you'll like her Seemed like the least I could do. Cause when he's chargin' his chopper Up and down your carpeted halls You will think I am dressed up quite proper Never mind how I stumble and fall.  You imagine me sipping champagne from your boot For taste of your elegant pride I may be going to hell in a bucket, babe But at least I'm enjoying the ride, at least I'll enjoy the ride.  Cause you're a sweet little softcore pretender Somehow, babe, it got as hot as it gets With her black leather and gold spike suspenders And your chain, your black whip and pets.  Well we know you're the reincarnation Of the infamous Catherine the Great And we know how you love the ovation And the scene that it seems to create.  You imagine me sipping champagne from your boot For taste of your elegant pride I may be going to hell in a bucket, babe But at least I'm enjoying the ride, at least I'll enjoy the ride.  You analyze me, tend to despise me You laugh when I stumble and fall There may come a say when I'll dance on your grave Unable to dance I'll still crawl across it Unable to dance I'll still crawl Unable to dance I'll still crawl Unable to dance I'll crawl.  You must really consider the circus It just might be your kind of zoo I can't think of a place that's more perfect For a person as perfect as you.  And it's not like I'm leaving you lonely Cause I wouldn't know where to begin Well I know you wake up here only When the snakes come marching in.  You imagine me sipping champagne from your boot For taste of your elegant pride I may be going to hell in a bucket, babe But at least I'm enjoying the ride, at least I'll enjoy the ride. Ride, ride, ride Ride, ride, ride Ride, ride, ride At least I'll enjoy the ride. At least I'll enjoy the ride. AT LEAST I'LL ENJOY THE RIDE.
