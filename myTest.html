                Welcome To My Grateful Dead HTML Generating TwitterBot!
            </h1>
            <p>
                This bot was made both as a personal project to familiarize myself with the twitter api
                and out of a deep irrational love for Grateful Dead. I'm a cat mom, deadhead, Taco Bell enthusiast, and a computer engineer.
                This project was developed using python with the tweepy library  and using tools such as Git and Visual Studio.
                The intended purpose of this bot was host a monthly CSS competition through twitter by providing pseudorandom
                generated HTML files. The HTML file is not to be edited and only the CSS file (style.css) is to be submitted.
            </p>
