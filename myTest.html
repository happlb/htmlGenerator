                Welcome To My Grateful Dead HTML Generating TwitterBot!
            </h1>
            <p>
                This bot was made both as a personal project to familiarize myself with the twitter api
                and out of a deep irrational love for Grateful Dead. I'm a cat mom, deadhead, Taco Bell enthusiast, and a computer engineer.
                This project was developed using python with the tweepy library  and using tools such as Git and Visual Studio.
                The intended purpose of this bot was host a monthly CSS competition through twitter by providing pseudorandom
                generated HTML files. The HTML file is not to be edited and only the CSS file (style.css) is to be submitted.

                Tom Thumb Blues  When your lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter time too When your gravity is down and negativity won't pull you through Don't you put on any airs when you down on Rue Morgue Avenue. They got some hungry creatures there they'll surely make a mess out of you  If you see St Annie, please tell her thanks alot My thoughts they are twisted, my tentacles are all in a knot I don't even have the strength to get up and take another shot. Now my best friend, my drummer, won't even tell what it was that I dropped  Now sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the goddess of gloom. She speaks good English as she invites you up into her room. And you, you were so damn conscientious, you couldn't go to her too soon Still she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon.  Up on Housing Project Hill, it's either fortune or fame You must choose one or the other though neither are to be what they claim If you're looking to get silly, you better get back from where you came You know the cops don't need you and we all expect the same.  Now all the authorities, they just lay around and boast About how they blackmailed the President into leaving his post. And picking up Angel, Who arrived up here from the coast, Who looked so fine at first, but left looking like a ghost.  Now I started out heinakin, still hit the harder stuff Everybody swore they stand behind me when the game got rough But the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to call my bluff I'm goin' back to San Enselmo, I do believe I had enough.
