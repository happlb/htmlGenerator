Lindy

I know they're gonna run take me
When they get across the sea
Ever' chance, those women; Watch-it's amazing
It's all safe and now sugar baby

Oh Mama, don't you weep and moan, Uncle Sam got your man and gone.
Now then they're doin' the Lindy Bird across the sea.

Oh Mama, how can it be, You went way across the sea
Just to keep from doing that Lindy fight with me
Oh baby, well I done just told'ja now

Oh Mama, don't you weep and moan, Uncle Sam got your man and gone.
Now then they're doin' the Lindy Bird across the sea.

She said, "Let me play the blues on your piano
And then I'll do that Lindy thing with you."
Mary had a dream about a submarine.

I asked her for a glass of payolla;
She said, "Let me play the blues on your Victrola,
And then I'll do that Lindy fight with you."
