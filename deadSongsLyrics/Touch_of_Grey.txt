Touch of Grey

Must be getting early, clock are running late.
Paint my love a morning sky, it's all cold.
Dawn is breaking everywhere, light a candle, curse the glare
Draw the curtains I don't care, but it's alright
I will get by, I will get by, I will get by, I will survive.

I see you've got your list out, say your piece and kiss off.
Guess I get the jist of it, but it's alright
Oh well anyway, sorry that you feel that way.
Every silver linings got a touch of grey
I will get by, I will get by, I will get by, I will survive.

It's a lesson to me, the ablers and the beggars and the theives
The abc's we all think of, try to win a little love.

I know the rent is in arrears, the dog has not been fed in years
It's even worse than it appears, but it's alright

Cow is giving kerosene, kid can't read at seventeen
The words he knows are all obscene, but it's alright
I will get by, I will get by, I will get by, I will survive.

Shoe is on the hand that fits, that's all there really is to it
Whistle through your teeth and spit, but it's alright

Oh well a touch of gray, kinda suits you anyway,
That's all I had to say, but it's alright
I will get by, I will get by, I will get by, I will survive.

It's a lesson to me, the devils and the East and the free
The abc's we all must face, try to save a little grace.
