So Far From Me

You say you want to try again
Well you don't realize
That I have a better end in mind.

It doesn't seem you really have to
Close your eyes to see
Though I hope you don't need me
You are so far from me.

There was something I had caught inside
Screaming hard to make it go
And tied me down low
It doesn't seem you really have to
Close your eyes to see
You have been all you'll be
It's just you babe
And we can't relate at all.

It doesn't seem you really have to
Close your eyes to see
Though I hope you don't need me
You are so far from me.

This time's the last time i want to say so long
this song's my last song for you
There's just nothing here to hold on to babe
Nothing to hold on to.

Spoonful

Could have been a spoonful of coffee
Could have been a spoonful of tea
Just a little spoon of your precious love is good enough for me
Man lies about that, man cries about that
Man dies about that, spoonful, spoonful, spoonful

Could have been a spoonful of water
Spread out on the desert sand
Just a little spoon fortifies, save you from another man
Man lies about that, man cries about that
Even dies about that, spoonful, spoonful, spoonful

Could have been a spoonful of diamonds
Could have been a spoonful of gold
Just a little spoon of your precious love to satisfy my soul

Everybody's talking about spoonful
Spoonful, spoonful, spoonful
Everybody's fighting about spoonful
