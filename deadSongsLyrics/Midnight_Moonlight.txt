Midnight Moonlight

If you ever feel lonesome when you're down in San Antone
Beg, steal or borrow two nickels or dime to call me on the phone
And I'll meet you at Alamo Mission, where we can say our prayers
The Holy Ghost and the Virgin Mother will heal us as we kneel there
In the moonlight, in the midnight, in the moonlight, midnight, moonlight

If you ever feel sorrow for the deeds you have done
With no hope for tomorrow in the setting of the sun
And the ocean is howling for the things that might have been
And that last good morning sunrise will be the brightest you've ever seen
In the moonlight, in the midnight, in the moonlight, midnight, moonlight
