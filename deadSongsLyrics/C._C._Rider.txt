Well now C., C. C. Rider, well now see, see what you have done.
Well you made me love you woman, now your man is gone.

I'm goin' away now baby and I won't be back till fall,
Just might find me a good girl might not be commin' back at all.

Well now C., C. C. Rider, see now the moon is shining bright,
Well now C., C. C. Rider, see now the moon is shining bright,
Just might find me that good girl and everything would be alright.
