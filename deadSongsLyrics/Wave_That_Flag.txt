Wave That Flag

Wave that flag, pop the bag, skin the goat, learn to cope
Bell the rat, trap the cat, ball the jack, chew the fat
Read the signs, connect the lines, pay your fines, save your dimes
Pick up time, light the fuse, making time, pass the juice

Eat at days, hide in caves, pull the tooth, stretch the truth
Feed the poor, starve the war, pick up chicks, catch the fix
Get your kicks, pick up sticks, trim your wick, take your pick
Try your tricks, impress the chicks

Wash the fence, dig the den, live the vain, die in shame
Catch the fool, burn the stew, shine your shoes, sing the blues

Wave the flag, pop the bag, bell the cat, trap the rat
Ball the jack, chew the fat, shoot the breeze, lose the keys
Read the signs, connect the lines, pay your fines, read the rhyme
Shhot the breeze, lose your keys, don't be late, what I say

Stretch the truth, pull the tooth, feed the poor, starve the war
Cash the fix, get your kicks, trim your wick, take your pick
Try your tricks, impress the chicks

Wash the fence, dig the den, live the shame,die in vain
Catch the fool, burn the stew, shine your shoes, sing the blues
