Let Me In 83968

A little boy knocked at the warden's door at Sing Sing
Said in tears, "Yes sir, I understand that 83968 lives here."
He's my daddy, sir, and I just got to be near him
And if you can't let him out then you just got to let me in

Let me in, let me in, 83968's my dad
I watched the burial of my mama
Now he's all in the world that I have
But I can break your little rocks with a hammer in my hand
I just got to be near daddy, Mr. Warden please let me in

When I checked through California happy trails out on the rock
From Folsom on to Jacksonville, no one had my heart
When I found the newspaper clipping in my mama's souvenirs
And now I'm here in Sing Sing 83968
