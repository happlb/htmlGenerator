Aiko Aiko

My spy boy saw you spy boy sittin' by the fi-yo
My spy boy told your spy boy, "I'm gonna set you flag on fi-yo."

I said, "Hey now," "Hey now,"
Aiko Aiko all day, jockomo feno na na nay, jockomoa feena nay.

My grandma and your grandma were sitting by the fire
Said my grandma to your grandma, "Gonna get your tail on fire."

I said, "Hey now," "Hey now,"
Aiko Aiko all day, jockomo feno na na nay, jockomo feena nay.
