You Don't Have To Ask

If you wanna know what time it is, you don't have to ask
If you wanna know what something is, you don't have to ask
If you wanna know whats real or not, you don't have to ask
If you wanna know what time is now, you don't have to ask
You don't have to ask, you already know

If you wanna leave just close your eyes, you don't have to ask
If you wanna go and lose your mind, you don't have to ask
If it's peace that you're looking for
You got the key to every door, you already know

If there's a way out you'll find out and free all and be all beyond
You never wonder what sky you been under that made you forget all this time

If you're looking for it, you don't have to ask
You can see it plain as day, you don't have to ask
If you try to find us true, just take a look at you, you don't have to ask
