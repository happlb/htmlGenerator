Baby, What Do You Want Me To Do

You got me running, you got me hiding,
You got me running, hiding, hiding, running,
Anywhere you want it, let it roll, yeah, yeah, yeah,
Hey, you got me where you want me, baby doing what you want me to do.

Going up, going down, going up, down, down, up,
Anyway you want it, let it roll, yeah, yeah, yeah,
Yeah, you got me where you want me, baby doing what you want me to do.

I say, honey baby, honey you don't have to go,
I'm going to pack my bag, baby, down that road I go,
Roll on, roll on baby, honey what is wrong with you?
Now baby, baby, baby,...
Oh baby, honey what is wrong with you?
You don't treat your baby, treat me like you used to do.
