The Night They Drove Ole Dixie Down

Virgil Caine is the name and I served on the Denver train
Stoneman's cavalry came and tore up the tracks again
In the winter of '65 we was hungry, just barely alive
By May 10, Richmond had fell, it was a time I remember, oh so well

The night they drove ole Dixie down, all the bells were ringing
The night they drove ole Dixie down, all the people were singing
Na, na na na na na na, na na na na na na, na na na na na na

Back with my wife in Tennessee one day she called for me
Virgil quick come see there goes the "Robert E. Lee"
I don't mind chopping wood and I don't care if the money's no good
Take what you need and leave the rest
They should never have taken the very best

Like my father before me, I'm a peaceful man
Like my brother before me, I took a rebel stand
Just 18, proud and gray, but a Yankee laid him in his grave
Swear by the blood running through (on) my feet
You can't raise a Caine back up when he's in defeat
