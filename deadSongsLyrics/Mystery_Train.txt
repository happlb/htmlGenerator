Mystery Train

Train I ride, sixteen coaches long. Train I ride, sixteen coaches long.
Well, the woman I love, she's on that train and gone.

Train I ride, rollin' down the track. Train I ride, rollin' down the track.
It took my baby, and it's never comin' back.

Well I went to the station, to meet my baby at the gate
Asked the station master, "Is your train running late?"
She said she'd be waiting on the 5:45
Well, I hate to tell you boys that train don't stop here no more.

Mystery train, rolling down the track. Mystery train, rolling down the track.

Heard that whistle blow across the middle of the night
When I got down to the station the train was way out of sight.
