Cocaine Habit Blues

Tell it to me, tell it to me
Drink cold liquor let the cocaine be Cocaine'll kill my honey dead
Walking down the street with a dollar in my hand
Looked for a woman ain't got no man Cocaine'll kill my honey dead
Love my whiskey, I'll love my gin
But the way I love coke is all of a sin Cocaine'll kill my honey dead
Cocaine's dose is not for a man
Doctor said pretty soon, but he don't say when Cocaine'll kill my honey dead
