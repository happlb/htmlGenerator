Hey Little One

Hey, hey little one so far from home and so alone
Hey, hey little one I'm just like you I'm lonely too
The road we ride is a long, long road when you are all alone
But I found you and I found our love, a love I've never known

Hey, hey little one don't go away, tell me you'll stay
Tell me, tell me, tell me you'll stay
