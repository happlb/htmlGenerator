Tom Dooley

Hang your head, hang your head, Tom Dooley hang your head and cry
Killed poor Laura Foster, you know you're bound to die
Bury her on the hillside, make the people see
Put the coat over, tromp her with your feet

Hang your head Tom Dooley, hang your head and cry
Killed poor Laura Foster, don't you know your bound to die
Bury her on the hillside with other people's lives
Hang your head Tom Dooley, hang your head and cry
Killed poor Laurea Foster, don't you know you're bound to die

First time I went courting, pretty brave of me
Just to sing from her old oak tree
Hang your mama with kindness blame it on this morning
