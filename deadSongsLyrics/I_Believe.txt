I Believe

I don't feel like I can, I don't feel like I can
But if anybody hears this sermon I want you to know
I want you to know that I had tried to save my business true
I just couldn't handle 'cause the devil's got into my bones
'Cause the devil's in everybody's bones
Well the devil's in my bones, in your bones, in his bones
And you can't do right all the time. If you try you gonna die someplace
You gonna die someplace lonely

You got nothing to keep it cool, I got one thing to say
I believe, I believe, I got to believe in, but I'm done
And you know that I;m believin' Oh Lord
I believe in everything standing for I believe in my woman too
I believe in my woman more than you my Lord
