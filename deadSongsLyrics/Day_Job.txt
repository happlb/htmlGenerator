Day Job

Maybe you collect or maybe you pay (whether)
Still got to work that eight hour day
Whether you like that job or not
You'd better keep it on ice while you're lining up your long shot

Which is to say, hey hey, keep yer day job
Don't give it away, keep yer day job, whatever they say
Keep yer day job 'till your night job pays.

Steady boys starting that eight day hour
Never underrate that paycheck power
By now you know that the face on your dollar
Got a thumb on its nose and a hand on your collar
With a chance to say, hey hey, keep yer day job....

Daddy may drive a V-8 'Vette
Mama may bathe in champagne yet
God bless the child that's got his own stash
Nine to five and a place to crash
which is to say...
Sunday comes forget about work, Ring that bell for whatever it's worth.
If you ask me like I know you won't
I'll tell you what to do what I know that you won't.
