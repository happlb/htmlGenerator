Cold Jordan

Oh sinning is a gentilized journey, take Jesus as your daily guide
Though you may feel pure and saintly without Him walking by your side
And when you come to make your crossing at the end of the pilgrim's way
If you ever will meet your savior, you will surely meet him on that day

Now look at that cold Jordan, look at its deep water
Look at that wide river Oh heavy mighty billows roll
You better take Jesus with you, he's a true companion
Oh I'm sure without him that you never will make it home

That awful day of judgement is coming in the by and by
We'll see our Lord descending in the glory from on high
Oh, let us get in touch with Jesus and in the special love of God
And maybe ever get ready when he comes on Jordan's tide
Now look at that cold Jordan, look at its deep water
Look at that wide river Oh heavy mighty billows roll
You better take Jesus with you, he's a true companion
Oh I'm sure without him that you never will make it home

Now what you gonna do, Oh what you gonna say
Oh how you gonna feel when you come to the end of the way?
