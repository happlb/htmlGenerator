Tore Up Over You

Ever since you been gone I just cried the whole night long
Since the day you said goodbye left me sore, no lie, no lie

Tore up over you, and I just can't find my way.
Tore up! Yeah, yeah, yeah, tore up.
Woh-oh-oh tore up! Yeah, yeah, yeah, tore up.
Tore up over you, and I just can't find my way.

Never loved me like ya told me so if you did how could you go?
It was you, not me, that left and went away with someone else

Tore up over you, and I just can't find my way.
Tore up! Yeah, yeah, yeah, tore up.
Woh-oh-oh tore up! Yeah, yeah, yeah, tore up.
Tore up over you, and I just can't find my way.

Tell me what can I do to make to come back and stay?

Tore up over you, and I just can't find my way.
Tore up! Yeah, yeah, yeah, tore up.
Woh-oh-oh tore up! Yeah, yeah, yeah, tore up.
Tore up over you, and I just can't find my way.
