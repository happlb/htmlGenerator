Playin' In The Band

Some folks trust to reason others trust to might,
I don't trust to nothin', but I know it comes out right.

Say it once again now, Whoa, I hope you'll understand
When it's done and over, Lord, a man is just a man.

Playin', playin' in the band. Daybreak, daybreak on the land.

Some folks look for answers others look for fights,
Some folks up in treetops just a looking for their kites.

Whoa, I can tell your future just look what's in your hand,
But I can't stop for nothin' I'm just playing in the band.

Playin', playin' in the band. Daybreak, daybreak on the land.

Standin' on a tower world at my command
You just keep a turnin' while I'm playing in the band.

And if a man among you got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me for playing in the band.

Playin', playin' in the band. Daybreak, daybreak on the land.
