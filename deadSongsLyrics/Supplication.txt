Supplication

Well, dizzy ain't the word for the way that you're making me feel now
Well, I need some indication, girl, if all of this is real now, tell me girl now

Well, I've heard it said there's something wrong in my head, now
Got to help me, girl, now
Could it be infatuation or am I just being misled now?

Little bolt of inspiration Way you strike me now
Sparking my imagination, got the lightning now
Cause me such excitation, got the lightning now
'Bout to end my suffocation, come on strike me now
Little bolt of inspiration Way you strike me now, she's back in my imagination
