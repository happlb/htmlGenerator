Long Black Limousine

Down through the city their fancy cars are such a sight to see
At first look your rich friends that took you innocently
That now they finally called you home to me

Papers told about you lost your life
Of the party and the famous crash that night
Racing on the highway that turns nobody saint
Now you're driving in that long black limousine
