Revolutionary Hamstrung Blues

Halfway past cool on Monday for the sight of her
Rode in town while he built afar with the riders and then the poor
Hot damn, it's a mother's day, don't you all look fine
Promenading down long car ocean, yes it's mine and it's sniffing white

They got poets, shuckers and godzilla's 'round
Mother's sweet little frozen no suit
We got Speed Racer and his archaic as words Revolutionary Hamstrung
Blues

Bringin' all the mares hide in your cabs, honey now loosen your load
You belong to this has-no-name, what I
I remember some chicks from the sciz would come along and sit and squeeze too
Silly says, I say it once, for you it's cold steel and slow
It's sounds have all ruptured, it sounds just like glass
Suspect out in the corners, sounding verse and kickin' ass
I felt the city have a narly, don't make the 6 o'clock news
Speed Racer and the band here playing

As I recall I went for the window, but I never did get me there
Hit me hard with his hickory stick was the last thing I saw, met you
Drag me down and tangle, you carry the charges if you feel
Pray for the day that one yourself, but then figure we'll lick a few

But when I try to look up, don't want to let me loosen your load
Here alone take this grenade for me, well I

The fore runner radiates wild help up far now, gun ships pass so far
Pass me a vote, silly, and how we did it all over
Did it all over, did it all over the road

We got broads, suckers and guys in this jail mother sweet little frozen no suit
We got Speed Racer and his archaic am words Revolutionary Hamstrung Blues
