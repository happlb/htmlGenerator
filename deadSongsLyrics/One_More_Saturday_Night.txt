One More Saturday Night

I went down to the mountain, I was drinking some wine,
Looked up in the heavens Lord I saw a mighty sign,
Writt'n fire across the heaven, plain as black and white;
Get prepared, there's gonna be a party tonight.

Uhuh, Hey! Saturday Night!
Yeh, uhuh one more Saturday night,
Hey Saturday night!

Everybody's dancin' down the local armory
With a basement full of dynamite and live artillery.
The temperature keeps risin', everybody gittin' high;
Come the rockin' stroke of midnite, the whole place gonna fly.

Uhuh, Hey! Saturday Night!
Yeh, uhuh one more Saturday night,
Hey Saturday night!

Turn on channel six, the President comes on the news,
Says, "I get no satisfaction, that's why I sing the blues."
His wife say "Don't get crazy, Lord, you know just what to do,
Crank up that old Victrola, put on them rockin' shoes."

Uhuh, Hey! Saturday Night!
Yeh, uhuh one more Saturday night,
Hey Saturday night!

Then God way up in heaven, for whatever it was worth,
Thought He'd have a big old party, thought He'd call it planet Earth.
Don't worry about tomorrow, Lord, you'll know it when it comes,
When the rock and roll music meets the risin' sun.
