Queen Of Santa Fe I

When I was a boy about seventeen I went down to the railroad yard
I hopped on Santa Fe Queen all the way to Boston for coal mines
I lit out from my home I hitch hiked to Statson
I went around there, found me a yard, I asked the old hobo, said:
Said, "I don't care, man, I just ride the ride."
