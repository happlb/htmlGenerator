Road Runner

Money, who needs it, let me live a life free and easy
Put the toothbrush in my hand and let me be a travelling man
I'm a road runner, I'm a road runner baby, can't stay in one place too long
I'm a road runner, one look at me and I'll be gone
Well you can love me if you want to, but I do declare
When I get restless I got to move somewhere
Yes, I'm a road runner baby, got to keep on keeping on
And I love the life I live and I'm gonna live the life I love

Don't want love to tie me down, you know I got to be free to roam around
All my life I've been like this, you can love me at your own risk
When the dust hits my shoes, I got the urge to move
I'm a road runner baby, got to keep on keeping on
And I love the life I live and I'm gonna live the life I love

I'm a road runner baby, got to keep on keeping on
I'm a road runner, one look at me and I'll be gone
You can love me if you want to, but I do declare
When I get restless I got to move somewhere
Since I'm a road runner baby, got to keep on keeping on
And I love the life I live and I'm gonna live the life I love
Road runner, yeah
