You Win Again

The news is out, all over town that you've been seen, out runnin' 'round.
I know that I should leave her there,
But then I just can't go, you win again.
This heart of mine, could never see what everybody knows but me.
Just trustin' you was my great sin, I just can't go, Lord
You win again. What can I do, Lord, You win again.
