Last Train to Jacksonville

Are you lonely for me baby, are you lonely for me baby
Are you lonely for me baby, last train to Jacksonville
I'll get on it baby, you know I will, come on and try
Go ahead and try to get on that train, I want you

Go and cry baby, go ahead and cry
Know I'm the one to hurt you, I'm lonely baby, lonely and blue
I'm lonely baby, I'm lonely for you, are you lonely for me baby?

This time I'm going to Jacksonville
Are you going, sweet baby, or are you staying?
Tell your friend it's the end of restlessly searching

Said I was born to hurt you, I'm sorry baby, sorry and blue
I'm lonely baby, I'm lonely for you, are you lonely for me baby?

Are you going, sweet baby, or are you staying?
Say you'll be there, got a feeling that when I get on the train girl
When the feeling, I got a feeling that without your love baby

I'm lonely babe, lonely and blue, I'm sorry baby, long before you
Are you lonely for me baby?
