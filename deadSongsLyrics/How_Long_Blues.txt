How Long Blues

Now listen to me mama, I can't sleep no more around here
How long, how long, ain't had no loving, how long, how long

I hate that train, train that carried my babe away
And left me standing, how long, how long
Ain't had no loving since my babe been gone
Now listen to me mama, why did you make me go around here
Ain't had no loving, how long, how long?
