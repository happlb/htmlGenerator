Never Trust A Woman

I see some good times, I gotta get to ring that bell
I gotta see some good times
Sometimes you make up for when I'm not feeling well
It must be due to some great times
Cause right now I feel like hell

Never trust a woman who wears her pants too tight
She might love you tomorrow, but she'll be gone tomorrow night

Come tomorrow I'll get my pay to leave this town
She don't really love me
Ain't no reason to stick around
