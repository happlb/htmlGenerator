One Thing To Try

Break out your bottle, be in trouble by noon
Never get satisfaction cause ya boil too soon
Them downtown chippies know your weight to the ounce
But the harder you fall, Jack, the higher you bounce!

Stoke up your get, be ready to ride
Keep your head and your heart inside
Take it as far as you wanna go
Until we can't see the desert for the burning snow

But if you're in a hurry, I really go to go,
If you're in a hurry, might have to find out slow
That it's one thing to try, another to fly,
You get there quicker just a step at a time,
It's one thing to bark and another to bite,
The show ain't over til you pack up at night.

Ah well, ninety-nine people all running around
Not one in a hundred got his feet on the ground,
In fact one in a thousand holding some in reserve
For when the real, true action comes around the curve.

Take care of your people, get some of them fed
Hide the ones in trouble out under your bed
Keep an eye to the future, an ear to the past
Cause after thinkin' it over, know there's nothing much lasts.

So if you're in a hurry, I really go to go
If you're in a hurry, might have to find out slow
That it's one thing to try, another to fly,
You get there quicker just a step at a time,
It's one thing to bark and another to bite,
The show ain't over til you pack up at night.

Don't ever let it get the best of you
Plan what you can, let the rest shine through
Just so many angles you can possibly see
Got to figure on those let the other ones be

Don't be a collector of more than you need
Got a lot of things growing but keep watching your seeds
Got to sprout in December what you planted in May
If the harvest is empty, find some other good way

But if you're in a hurry, I really go to go,
If you're in a hurry, might have to find out slow
That it's one thing to try, another to fly,
You get there quicker just a step at a time,
It's one thing to bark and another to bite,
The show ain't over til you pack up at night.
