Easy To Love You

Good, good morning, so good to see you weren't just a dream of mine
Real as a raven, real as thunder, real as the sun shinin'
But still so very undefined
Can't imagine what's behind those sleepy eyes

Little stranger, don't try to hide now
You look so young when you're afraid
There is no danger, but from the devil
He may want you, but I'm in his way

You don't know how easy it is
You don't know how easy it is to love you

And come the moonrise when the dew falls
Don't be the sun that fades away
Don't leave me darkness, she's no lover, she hides the day
