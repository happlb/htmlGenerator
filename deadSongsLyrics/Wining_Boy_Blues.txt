Wining Boy Blues

Just a wining boy don't deny my name
Just a wining boy don't deny my name, wining boy don't deny my name
Pick it up and shake it, stir the chain
Wining boy don't deny my name
Lookie here, sister, sister, dirty little sow
I said no, sister, sister, dirty little sow
Sister, sister, dirty little sow
Want to be a bad girl, but don't know how
Wining boy don't deny my name
Just a wining boy don't deny my name, deny my name
Wining boy don't deny my name
Pick it up and shake lovie, stir the chain
