Two Women

I got two women, yes I've got, one need me feel, but I need you
Been so strange, I don't know what I've done
I think I'm freezin' in the heat of the sun.

My woman say she love me, say what'll wanna do you
I just don't know what to do, I know I love her, but another woman mine
I just don't know what to do, can't be the one who's cryin'

And I feel so strange about what I've done
Yes, you know I feel like a freezin', freezin' in the heat of the sun
I say why have I always got two rollin' the same ol' time?
