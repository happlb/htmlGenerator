I'm A Hog For You

I'm a hog for you baby, can't get enough of your love
When I go to sleep at night that's what I'm dreaming of

One little piggie went to London
One little piggie went to Hongkong
This little piggie's comin' over your house

One little piggie ate pizza
One little piggie ate potato chips
This little piggie's comin' over your house
Gonna level with your sweet lips
