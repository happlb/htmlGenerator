Tomorrow Is Forever

Take my hand and run with me out of the past called yesterday
and walk with me into the future on to tomorrow
Yesterday my sweetful life rolled again back no matter what
There is nothing left but memories that bring sorrows
Yesterday is gone but tomorrow is forever

No more cryin' and memories find their way back
Tomorrow's waiting let's journey there together
Yesterday is gone but tomorrow is forever

I care no for yesterday, I love you as you are today
We must forget the passing time
My love for you is the real kind of love that won't hurt you forever
Yesterday is over. tomorrow is forever
