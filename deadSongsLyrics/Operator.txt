Operator

Operator, can you help me, help me if you please.
Give me the right area code and the number that I need.
My rider left upon the Midnight Flyer,
Singin' like a summer breeze.

I think she's somewhere down South, down about Baton Rouge,
But I just can't remember no number, a number I can use.
Directory don't have it, central done forgot it,
I've gotta find a number to use.

Trying to check out her number, trying to run down her line.
Operator said that's priv'ledged information,
And it ain't no business of mine.
It's floodin' down in Texas, poles are out in Utah,
Gotta find a private line.

She could be hangin' 'round the steel mill,
Working in a house of blue lights.
Riding a getaway bus out of Portland, talking to the night.
I don't know where she's going, I don't care where she's been,
Long as she's doin' it right. Long as she's doin' it right.
