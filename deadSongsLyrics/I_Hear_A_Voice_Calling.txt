I Hear A Voice Calling

I hear a voice calling it must be our Lord
Must be, must be our Lord
It's coming from on heaven high I hear a voice calling
I hear the reward, I hear the reward
On the land we shall never die
Jesus will die on cold calvary, He's shed His last blood
That the world might be free
So follow His footsteps up and down the way
I'll be preparing for the great judgement day
