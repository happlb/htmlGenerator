Silver Threads and Golden Needles

I don't want your lonely mansion with a tear in every room
All I want's the love you've promised beneath the halo moon
But you think I should be happy with your money and your name
Sit alone and hide my sorrows while you play your cheatin' game

Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine
And I dare drown my sorrow in the warm glow of your mind
You can't buy my love with money 'cause I ain't never been that kind
Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine
