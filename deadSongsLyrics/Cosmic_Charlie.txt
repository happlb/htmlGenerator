Cosmic Charlie

Cosmic Charlie how do you do? Truckin' in style along the avenue.
Dum de dum de dooodley do. Go on home your mama's calling you.
Kalico, Kahlia, come tell me the news.
Calamity's waiting for a way to get to her.
Rosy red and electric blue I bought you a paddle for your paper canoe.

Say you'll come back when you can Whenever your airplane happens to land.
Maybe I'll be back here too It all depends on what's with you.
Hung up waiting for a windy day kite one ice since the first of February.
Mama keeps saying that the wind might blow ,
But standing here I say I just don't know.

New ones comin' as the old ones go,
Everything's moving here but much too slow now,
A little bit quicker and we might have time,
To say "How do you do?" before we're left behind.
Calliope wail like a seaside zoo. The very last lately inquired about you,
It's really very one or two. The first you wanted, the last I knew.

I just wonder if you shouldn't feel,
Less concerned about the people unreal.
The very first word is "How do you do?",
The last "Go home your mama's callin' you."

Calling you, calling you, calling you, calling you,
Go on home your mama's calling you.
