Deep Elem Blues

If You Go Down To Deep Elm Put Your Money In Your Shoes
The Women In Deep Elem They Give You The Deep Elem Blues

Oh, sweet Mama, Your Daddy's Got Them Deep Elem Blues

Once I Had A Girlfriend, She Meant The World To Me
She Went Down To Deep Elem, Now She Ain't What She Used To Be

Once I Knew A Percher, Preached THe Bible Thru And Thru
He Went Sown To Deep Elem, Now His Preaching Days Are Thru

When You Go Down To Deep Elem To Have A Little Fun,
Have Your Ten Dollars Ready When The Police Man Comes

When yo go down to Deep Elem put your money in your pants
Cause the women in Deep Elem they don't give a man a chance

Oh, Sweet Mama, Your Daddy's Got Them Deep Elem Blues.
