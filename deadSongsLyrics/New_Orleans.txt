New Orleans

Well, come on everybody take a trip with me
Down the Mississippi, down to New Orleans
They got the honeysuckle blaming on the honeysuckle vine
And love is blaming there all the time
They got the French boys swinging from a big old tree
Down the Mississippi, down in New Orleans

Well, come on take a stroll down on Basin Street
And listen to the music and the Dixieland beat
Oh, Magnolia blossom fills the air
And you ain't been to heaven if you ain't been there
Every Southern Belle is a Mississippi Queen
Down the Mississippi, down in New Orleans
