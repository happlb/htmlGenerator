The Harder They Come

Well they tell me of a pie up in the sky
Waiting for me when I die
But between the day you're born and when you die
They never seem to hear you even your cry.

So as sure as the sun will shine
I'm gonna get my share now, what's mine
And the harder they come, the harder they fall
The harder they come, the harder they fall one and all.

Well the oppressors are trying to keep me down
Trying to drive me underground
And they think that they have got the battle won
I say forgive them Lord they know not what they've done.

Cause as sure as the sun will shine
I'm gonna get my share now, what's mine
And the harder they come, the harder they fall
The harder they come, the harder they fall one and all.

And I'll keep on fighting for the things I want
Though I know that when you're dead you can't
But I'd rather be a free man in my grave
Than living as a puppet or a slave.

So as sure as the sun will shine
I'm gonna get my share now, what's mine
And the harder they come, the harder they fall
The harder they come, the harder they fall one and all.
