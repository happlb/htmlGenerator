Smokestack Lightnin'

Oh, smokestack lightnin', shinin' just like gold
Why can't you hear me cryin'? Ooooo
Oh, stop your train, let a hobo ride
Why can't you hear me cryin'? Ooooo

Oh, fare you well, I never see you no more
Why can't you hear me cryin'? Ooooo

Oh, stop your train, let a poor boy ride, callin' yes I do
Let a poor boy ride, let his foot step on

Oh, who've been you baby, since I've been gone
