Gloria

Wanna tell you about my baby, you know she comes around
Just about five feet-four from her head to the ground
You know she comes around here just about midnight
she makes me feel so good, she makes me feel alright
And her name is G.L.O.R.I.A G.L.O.R.I.A
Gloria I wanna to shout it all night
Gloria I wanna to shout it all day

She comes around here just about midnight
She only come to make me feel good, she makes me feel alright
She comes walking down my street, she comes up to my house
Knockin' on my door, now she comes to my room
A she makes me feel alright
And her name is G.L.O.R.I.A. G.L.O.R.I.A.
Gloria I wanna to shout it all day
