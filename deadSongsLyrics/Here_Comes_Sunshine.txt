Here Comes Sunshine

Wake of the flood, laughing water, forty-nine,
Get out the pans, don't just stand there dreamin'
Get out of the way, get out of the way,

Here comes sunshine, here comes sunshine.

Line up a long shot maybe try it two times, maybe more,
Good to know you got shoes to wear when you find the floor,
Why hold out for more?

Here comes sunshine, here comes sunshine.

Askin' you nice, now, keep the mother rollin'
One more time, been down before,
You just don't have to go no more, no more.

Here comes sunshine, here comes sunshine.
