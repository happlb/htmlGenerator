Quin The Eskimo

Everybody's building the big ships and the boats.
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes.
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here everybody's gonna jump for joy.

Come all without, come all within.
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn.

Now I like to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet.
But guarding fumes and making haste, it ain't my cup of meat.
Everybody's just standing around 'neath the trees
feeding pigeons on a limb.
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, all the pigeons gonna run to him.

Come all without, come all within.
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn.

A cat's meow and a cow's moo, I can't recite 'em all.
Just tell me where it hurts and I'll tell you who to call.
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes.
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna wanna doze.

Come all without, come all within.
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn.
Come all without, come all within.
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn.
