Yellow Moon

Anxious hope and thoughts of love will never let me down, not let me go
Inside, my heart's a cage of ice Loved and lost,
Still toss the lonely dice
I burned the whole night long my thoughts were never far from you
Love that locks and binds must die
But when it dies a part of you dies too.

Born, born, born upon the world the restless heart keeps flying,
Trying to become the heart of home.
Love, love, love, it picks you up and spins you round,
Sits you right back down where you belong.

I don't fit my hat sometimes, I get so full of clouds
Every time I pass your door I hear you cry out loud
Sometimes I look the same to you as you have looked to me
My eyes get filled so full of stars, I don't know when I leave

Born, born, born upon the world the restless heart keeps flying,
Trying to become the heart of home.
Love, love, love, it picks you up and spins you round,
Sits you right back down where you belong.

Love is like the April rain that makes the harvest grow
And when it grows it's like the summer gold
Love is like the coloured leaves that drift down from the trees
One by one 'til every tale is told

Now if I go a dancing out across the yellow moon
I'll be home by morning if it doesn't come too soon
If you seek protection go and find a safer man
And if he can't give you what you want then come on by again.

Priestess of the sun and moon and goddess of the wind
You know too much to ever lose and not enough to win
Though you built your house upon the rock and not upon the sand
You're still looking out your window for another travelin' man.

Born, born, born upon the world the restless heart keeps flying,
Trying to become the heart of home.
Love, love, love, it picks you up and spins you round,
Sits you right back down where you belong.
