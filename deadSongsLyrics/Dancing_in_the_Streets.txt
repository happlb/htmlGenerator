Dancing in the Streets

Hey, comin' out around the world be ready for a brand new beat
Oh, summer's here and the time is right, oh, for dancing in the street
Dancing in Chicago (dancing in the street)
Down in New Orleans (dancing in the street)
In New York City (dancing in the street)

All we need is music, sweet music (sweet, sweet music)
They'll be music everywhere (everywhere)
They'll be laughing, singing, music swinging and dancing in the street

It doesn't matter what you wear just as long as you are there
They're dancing (dancing in the street) oh oh

This is an invitation across the nation the chance for folks to meet
There'll be swinging, swaying, music playing and dancing in the street

Philadelphia, PA now (dancing in the street)
Baltimore and D.C. (dancing in the street)
Can't forget them other cities (dancing in the street)
