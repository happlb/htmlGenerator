It's A Man's World

This is a man's world, this is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing without a woman or a girl

You know man made a car to take us over the road
Man made the train to carry heavy loads
Man made electric lights to take us out of the dark
Man made a boat for the water just like Noah made the ark

Think about a little baby girl and a little baby boy
Man makes then happy 'cause man makes them toys
And after man has made everything, everything in the world he can
man makes money to buy some other man
