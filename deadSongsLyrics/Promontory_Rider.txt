Promontory Rider

Promontory Rider, Territory Ranger.
Promontory Rider, whats makes you ride so high?
Put a loving star back in an empty sky.
Once the wind was warm and sweet, the ladies in lace.
Up there on the prominence the tears just freeze your face.
From a statutory picture, passport out of hell.
Left here by a stranger, seem to wish as well.
Sighed, Promontory Rider, Territory Ranger.

Asked me, "Can you thread a needle? Can you shoot the moon?"
Walk the silver screen, be a judgement at high noon?
Like any Promontory Rider, Territory Ranger, step up.

Ride on, ride on, ride
Ride upon the high ground, ride upon the low.
Promontory Rider what makes you ride so slow?
Pick me out with harden wings and fill my head with crowds.
I been crawlin' in this scene, but now I'm rollin' down.

Promontory Rider, Territory Ranger.
Promontory Rider used to ride so high.
I don't know these days just seem to ride on by.
Once the wind was warm and sweet, but this must be your place.
Cause you don't change this chilly range, for any other place.
Say, Promontory Rider, Territory Ranger.

Ride on, ride on, ride.
Promontory Rider, whats makes you ride so high?
Put a loving star back in an empty sky.
Movin' on the high ground, movin' on the low.
But Promontory Rider that was many years ago.
Pick me out with harden wings and fill my head with crowds.
I been crawlin' in this scene, but not I'm rollin' down.
Promontory Rider, Territory Ranger.

Movin' on the high ground, movin' on the low ground.
Promontory Rider step so high
I know I oculd be right and I maybe wrong.
But I'll think I'll miss you when your gone.
ABC WXYZ can ask for cover, just don't see me
