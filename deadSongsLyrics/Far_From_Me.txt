Far From Me

You say you want to try again, wear it down between the lines
Well, I have a better end in mind it doesn't seem to really have you
Close your eyes to see though I know you don't mean to be
You are so far from me

There was something I had caught inside screaming hard to make it go
And tied me down low, it doesn't seem you really have to
Close you eyes to see, you've been all you'll be to me
Though I know you don't mean to be, it's just too late
And we can't relate at all

This is the last time I wanna say so long
This song is my last song for you
There's just nothing here to hold on to
Baby, nothing to hold on to
