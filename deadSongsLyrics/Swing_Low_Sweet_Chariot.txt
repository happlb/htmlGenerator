Swing Low Sweet Chariot

Swing low, sweet chariot coming for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot coming for to carry me home

I looked over Jordan and what did I see coming for to carry me home
A band of angels is coming after me, coming for to carry me home.

If you come to heaven before I do, coming for to carry me home,
Tell all my friends I'll be coming there too coming for to carry me home.

Well I'm sometimes up and I'm sometimes down coming for to carry me home,
But I'd steal my soul if it ever were down coming for to carry me home.
