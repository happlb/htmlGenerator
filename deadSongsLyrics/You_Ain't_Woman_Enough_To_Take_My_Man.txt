You Ain't Woman Enough To Take My Man

You come to tell me something, you say I ought to know
That he don't love me anymore and I have to let him go
Oh, you say you're gonna take him, but I don't think you can
'Cause you ain't woman enough to take my man

Oh, women like you they come a dime a dozen,
For you to get him I'll have to move over
And I'm gonna stay right here
Well it'll be over my dead body, you better get out while you can
'Cause you ain't woman enough to take my man
