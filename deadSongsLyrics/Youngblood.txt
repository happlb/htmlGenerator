Youngblood

I saw her standing on the corner, yellow ribbon in her hair
I knew at once I was a goner, said lookie there, lookie there
Youngblood, youngblood, youngblood, I can't get you out of my mind

I tried to talk, my tongue was fractured
I tried to walk, but I was lame
Could'nt stop myseld from shouting
What's your name, what's your name?

Crazy stuff, sure look tough, had to follow her all the way home
Things went bad, I met her dad
He said "You better leave my daughter alone"

I could'nt sleep that night for trying, I saw the rising of the sun
All night long my heart felt like crying
You're the one, You're the one
