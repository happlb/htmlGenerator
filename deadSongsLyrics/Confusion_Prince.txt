Confusion Prince

If only I could be less blind, if only I knew what to find
Everywhere and all of the time, it's bending my mind
Confusion Prince is at my door
The crown I wear is the one he wore
He's here to bring me down some more and bend my mind
The friendly stranger call my name
He only wants me for his game
But it don't matter just the same I bend his mind
I'll wave my flags into the sun
I fought my wars and now they're won
And I didn't need nobody's gun, I bend their mind
