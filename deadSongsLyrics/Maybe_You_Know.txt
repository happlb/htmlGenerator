Maybe You Know

Have you ever wanted something, wanted it so fuckin' bad.
That you'd lie, that you'd cheat, that you'd fight in the street.
A chance to lose what little you had.

Maybe you know I'll be there, maybe you know I'll be there
Maybe you know I'll be there, compared to you, I don't seem so mean.

I've been hearin' for a long time.
I've been hearin' about some loser band.
Ain't gettin' younger, but I ain't goin' under.
I was promised to rock & roll, this is sad.

Time is only wasted, talkin' that will take your life
When it all comes down, we're a couple of bums.
I know I'll get more tonite.

Now you don't owe me nothin', don't take it so personally.
There's only one way to make it today and I'm doing all I can for me.
