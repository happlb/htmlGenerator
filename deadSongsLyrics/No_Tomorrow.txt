No Tomorrow

Look over yonder tell me what you see Ten thousand people looking after me
I may be famous, I may be no-one, But in the ens all our races are run
Don't make my race run in vain, seems like there's no tomorrow
Seems like all my yesterdays were fitted in pain
There's nothing but darkness tomorrow

If you got to do like you said you do
If you got to change your mind and walk away
It don't seem to matter much anymore
Don't even ask me the time of day 'cause I don't know

Don't make me live in this pain no longer
You know I'm getting weaker not stronger
My poor heart can't stand much more
So why don't you just stop talking if you got to walk that dog
You start walking

I'll get by somehow, maybe not tomorrow, but somehow
I know someday I'll find someone who can ease my pain
Like you once done, yes, I know we had a good thing goin'
Seemed like a long time, like a long time

I didn't realize what was happenin' to my life
Till it was almost too late to say this
When I needed you, I needed you to lean on
You took your love and never gave it
Well this time is goodbye, so long
Maybe I must say "Take care and goodbye, so long"
Goodbye little girl I'm gone

You can go out and take your love
And give it to anybody who but a fool like me, would take it?
And maybe if they got a strong, strong heart
Then your love won't break it, but I'm gone, goodbye so long
