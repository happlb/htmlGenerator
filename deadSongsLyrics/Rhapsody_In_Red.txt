Rhapsody In Red

I love to hear that Rhapsody in Red
It just knocks me right outa my head
Lifts me up here just floatin' around
Sends me way up and it don't let down

I love to hear that Rhapsody in Red
On my feet or laid back in my bed
Takes me way back where I don't mind
Takes me way back in my time, in my time

Sail away on that Rhapsody in Red
Don't care where those other rainbows led
With all those Northern lights just blowin' away
Got no thought to relate in the same old way, anyway

Love to feel it flood down to my soul
Lovin' feel just like days of old
I sing blues where has it led
Gimmie some more Rhapsody in Red, in Red
