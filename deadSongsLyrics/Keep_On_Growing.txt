Keep On Growing

I was laughing, playing in the streets, I wasn't moving, I didn't know my fate
Playing the game of life was never really showing, I thought love would wait
I was a young man and I was sure to go astray
You walked right into my life and told me "Love would find a way"
Got to keep on growing, Keep on going, keep on flowing, yeah, yeah, yeah

I was standing looking in the face of one who loved me, feeling so ashamed
Hoping and praying, Lord, that she could understand me,
but I didn't know her name
She took my little hand in hers and she told me I was wrong
She said "You're gonna be alright boy, whoa, gonna take so long"
Got to keep on growing, Keep on going, keep on flowing, yeah, yeah, yeah

Baby, someday Baby, who knows where or when girl, just you wait and see
We'll be walking hand in hand alone as lovers, honest as can be
Time is gonna change us, Lord, I know it's true
Our love is gonna keep on growing and growing is all we're gonna do
All we're gonna do is
Keep on growing, Keep on going, keep on flowing, yeah, yeah, yeah
Keep on growing, Keep on knowing, keep on flowing, yeah, yeah, yeah
