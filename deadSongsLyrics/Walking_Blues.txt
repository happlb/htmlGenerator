Walking Blues

Woke up this morning, felt around for my shoes
That's when I knew I had them old walking blues
I woke up this morning, felt around, felt around for my shoes
That's when I knew I had them old, mean old walking blues

Leaving in the morning if I have to, robbed blind
I've been mistreated and I don't mind dying
I'm leaving in the morning if I have to, robbed blind
I've been mistreated and I just don't mind dying

She got a Belgium movement from her head down to her toes
Breaking on a dollar 'most anywhere she goes

Well I got a good woman coming my way
Tried to try, some electric pantin', some electric chillin' cryin'
But, ooh, mistook, misgiven
Got me up and walking Baby, but I'm walking blue, walking blue

Well some people say boy, the walking blues ain't bad
It's the worst old feelin' I 'most ever had
