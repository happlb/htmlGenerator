Dear Prudence, Won't You Come Out And Play ? Dear Prudence Meet The Brand New Day
The Sun Is Up, The Sky Is Blue, It's Beautiful and So Are You
Dear Prudence, Won't You Come Out And Play?

Dear Prudence, Open Your Eyes. Dear Prudence, Greet The Sunny Sky

Dear Prudence, Let Me See You Smile. Dear Prudence, Like A Little Child
The Clouds Will Be A Daisy-Chain So Let Me See You Smile Again
