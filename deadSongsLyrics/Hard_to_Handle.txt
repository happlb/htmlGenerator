Hard to Handle

Baby here I am and I'm a man upon the scene
I can give you what you want, but you got to come home with me
I got a whole lot of good ole loving and I got some in store
When I get through throwin' it on to you got to come back for more

Boys and things will come by the dozen
Ain't nothin' but drug store love
Pretty little thing let me light your candle
Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle, now yes I am.

Action speaks louder than words and I'm a man with great experience
I know you got another man, but I can love you better than him
Take my hand, don't be afraid I'm gonna prove every word I say
I'm advertising love for free so won't you place your ad with me?

Boys and things will come by the dozen
Ain't nothin' but drug store love
Pretty little thing let me light your candle

Give it to me baby, I got to have it, some of your love
It's all I need, early in the morning, late in the evening.
