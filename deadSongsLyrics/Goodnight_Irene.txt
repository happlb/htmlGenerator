Goodnight Irene

Goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene, I'll see you in my dreams
Sometimes I live in the country, sometimes I live in town
Sometimes I take a few notions, I want to jump overboard in a river and drown.

Goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene, I'll see you in my dreams
One night I got married, now me and my wife settled down
Now me and my wife are parting, I want to jump overboard in a river and drown.

Got My Mojo Working

I got my mojo working, just don't work on you
Some time, child, I just don't know what to do
Let it work, let it, when it's
When it's, work all day, all day, all day, work, work, work.
