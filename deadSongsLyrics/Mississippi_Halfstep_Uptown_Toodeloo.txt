Mississippi Halfstep Uptown Toodeloo

On the day when I was born Daddy sat down and cried.
I had the mark just as plain as day; which could not be denied.
They say that Cain caught Abel rollin' loaded dice;
Ace of Spades behind his ear and him not thinkin' twice.

Halfstep, Mississippi uptown toodeloo Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of Rock and Rye. Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way.

If all you got to live for is what you left behind,
Get yourself a powder charge and seal that silver mine.
Lost my boots in transit, baby, pile of smokin' leather.
I nailed a retread to my feet and prayed for better weather.

Halfstep, Mississippi uptown toodeloo Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of Rock and Rye. Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way.

They say that when your ship comes in, the first man takes the sails;
What's the point of callin' shots; this cue ain't straight in line.
Cue ball's made of styrofoam and no one's got the time.

Halfstep, Mississippi uptown toodeloo Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of Rock and Rye. Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way.

Across the Rio Grandeeo, Across the lazy river.
