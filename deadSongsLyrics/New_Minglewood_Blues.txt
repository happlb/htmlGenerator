New Minglewood Blues

I was born in a desert, Raised in a loin's den
And my number one occupation is stealing women from their men

If your down in Memphis, you best stop down minglewood
When I take a walk down there, all the women sure look good

If you can't believe me, it'll make it hard to believe in you
Cause we all need each other, well you know it's true
