This Time Forever

We had plenty of lovers, we put in our time
We were anything but blind
Just as certain angels of perpetual flight
When we met we saw the light
This time for sure, this time forever, but it turned to sand
Slipping through our hand, as time slipped away

She was a stranger, just a stranger, when I awoke and saw her face
She moved in for the winter, made a garden in May
Summer came and gone, I was gone when she left me
There was nothing to leave, swept away on a breeze
This time for sure, this time forever, but it turned to sand
Slipped right through our hand, as time slipped away
