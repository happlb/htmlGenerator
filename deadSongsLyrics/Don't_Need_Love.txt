Don't Need Love

I don't need love anymore, I don't need love anymore,
I don't need anyone to tell me that I do
I don't need love and I don't need you.

I try and I try to make it work,
I try and I try to make it work
I try and I try, yeah, I won't forget, I know,
Love gets you nowhere slow.

I want no more heartaches, no more goodbyes
Ain't no more real good love, only new love, but old love dies.

Ain't worth the time that it takes,
Ain't worth the time that it takes,
Ain't worth the endless hours of changes I go through,
I don't need love and I don't need you.

I don't need love anymore, I don't need love anymore,
I don't need anyone to tell me that I do
I don't need love and I don't need you.
