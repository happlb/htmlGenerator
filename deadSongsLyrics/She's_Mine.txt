She's Mine

Well she's little and she's low, right down on the ground
Well the way she acts makes a rabbit huddle 'round
She's mine, well she's mine little and low crippled and she's blind

Everybody's laughin' where I go 'cause I'm leading my old lady
Down the road, but she's mine
Well she's mine little and low poor child crippled and blind

She's my baby crippled and blind
She's still my girl, she's mine
